		<h2>Why are we tackling this problem?</h2>

		<div class="box">
			This year, our team is working to mitigate the environmental effects of
			methane produced in cattle rumen. Enteric methane emissions are one of the
			largest anthropogenic sources of this potent greenhouse gas (GHG)
			(Reisinger et al., 2021). Some research has prompted development of some
			solutions to address this issue, however existing feed additive solutions
			have limited efficacy and lack incentives for farmers to implement due to
			added feed cost (Hodge et al., 2024). Our solution involves *Chlorella
			vulgaris* microalgae engineered to express phage-based lytic enzymes
			specifically targeting methanogen populations. Not only is microalgae a
			nutrient-rich potential feed additive, but due to similar genetic
			engineering processes, this will act as a proof of concept for genetically
			modified plants expressing these enzymes (Saadaoui et al., 2021). Existing
			cellulose fermentation in the rumen degrades microalgae and plant cell
			walls, providing a release mechanism for the enzymes (Weimer et al.,
			2022). We envision an engineered crop-based solution to be simple to
			implement, and cost-effective. Existing research shows that some
			phage-based enzymes are capable of lysing cells in free form (Altermann et
			al., 2018). Further, a reduction in certain methanogens can result in a
			sustained microbiome shift to favour other hydrogen sinks, including
			reductive acetogenesis.
		</div>

		<div class="box">
			Methane is a potent GHG. Since 1950, atmospheric methane concentrations
			have surged by 70%, marking it one of the fastest-growing GHGs
			(Bačėninaitė et al., 2022). It is a critical concern due to its profound
			warming effect, which is 84 times more potent than CO2 over a twenty-year
			period (European Commission, 2023).
		</div>

		<div class="box">
			The global warming induced by methane has contributed to a range of
			critical issues, including rising temperatures, more frequent extreme
			weather events that worsen air quality, increased drought occurrences, and
			a rise in vector-borne diseases (European Commission, 2023). These factors
			collectively contribute to higher mortality rates among humans and other
			organisms.
		</div>

		<div class="box">
			According to the Global Methane Assessment by the Climate and Clean Air
			Coalition and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), reducing
			methane-associated GHGs could prevent more than 200,000 premature deaths,
			hundreds of thousands of emergency room visits due to asthma, and more
			than 20 million tonnes of crop losses annually by 2030 (2023).
		</div>

		<div class="yellow-box">
			This is made easier by methane’s relatively shorter life-span of 7-12
			years (Reisinger et al., 2021). Unlike persistent GHGs that remain in the
			atmosphere for centuries, methane's shorter duration means that reducing
			its emissions can lead to more immediate reductions in its warming effect.
			By decreasing methane emissions, we can mitigate its rapid contribution to
			global warming and potentially achieve quicker reductions in atmospheric
			GHG levels compared to longer-lived gases.
		</div>

		<h1 class="welcome-text">Why cows specifically?</h1>

		<div class="box">
			Enteric methane generated by anaerobic activity of methanogenic archaea in
			the rumen of cattle is the largest source of anthropogenic CH4 emissions
			(Reisinger et al., 2024). A fully developed cow can emit up to 500 litres
			of methane each day, accounting for approximately 3.7% of all GHG
			emissions.
		</div>

		<div class="box">
			Dairy/beef products are popular, particularly with a growing human
			population, and consumer behaviour alone is unlikely to change
			sufficiently to reduce climate change. As of 2023, in North America:

			in the United States — raised for a variety of food and consumer products
			including beef, veal, dairy and leather (United States Department of
			Agriculture, 2024)
		</div>
		<div>
			Targeting cattle provides for significant opportunity to reduce methane
			emissions and mitigate climate change.
		</div>
		<div>
			The rumen of cattle offers a unique environment for addressing this issue.
			Unlike greenhouse gases from industrial or domestic sources, mitigation
			measures can be implemented within a naturally occurring system in a way
			that is more realistic and less invasive than other means of reducing
			anthropogenic methane emissions in the sector. Instead of investing in
			alternate manure management approaches, such as anaerobic digesters, or
			expensive precision equipment (i.e., sensors), we can address the issue
			internally by altering microbial activity, at little inconvenience to
			agricultural stakeholders.
		</div>
		<div>
			Our solution developed through synthetic biology can be easily scaled up
			and distributed widely, ensuring that the benefits of reduced methane
			emissions can be realized across large populations of livestock
			efficiently without requiring significant changes in farming
			infrastructure.
		</div>
		<div>
			Not only that, our approach also easily complements other emission
			reduction measures, such as improved feeding strategies or breeding
			programs for low-methane-emitting cattle.
