		<h1 class="welcome-text">Why are we tackling this problem?</h1>

		<div class="box">
			The global warming induced by methane has contributed to a range of
			critical issues, including rising temperatures, more frequent extreme
			weather events that worsen air quality, increased drought occurrences, and
			a rise in vector-borne diseases (European Commission, 2023). These factors
			collectively contribute to higher mortality rates among humans and other
			organisms.
		</div>

		<div class="box">
			According to the Global Methane Assessment by the Climate and Clean Air
			Coalition and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), reducing
			methane-associated GHGs could prevent more than 200,000 premature deaths,
			hundreds of thousands of emergency room visits due to asthma, and more
			than 20 million tonnes of crop losses annually by 2030 (2023).
		</div>

		<div class="yellow-box">
			This is made easier by methaneâ€™s relatively shorter life-span of 7-12
			years (Reisinger et al., 2021). Unlike persistent GHGs that remain in the
			atmosphere for centuries, methane's shorter duration means that reducing
			its emissions can lead to more immediate reductions in its warming effect.
			By decreasing methane emissions, we can mitigate its rapid contribution to
			global warming and potentially achieve quicker reductions in atmospheric
			GHG levels compared to longer-lived gases.
		</div>

		<h1 class="welcome-text">Why cows specifically?</h1>

		<div class="box">
			Enteric methane generated by anaerobic activity of methanogenic archaea in
			the rumen of cattle is the largest source of anthropogenic CH4 emissions
			(Reisinger et al., 2024). A fully developed cow can emit up to 500 litres
			of methane each day, accounting for approximately 3.7% of all GHG
			emissions.
		</div>

		<div class="box">
			Dairy/beef products are popular, particularly with a growing human
			population, and consumer behaviour alone is unlikely to change
			sufficiently to reduce climate change. As of 2023, in North America:
