			# Engineering Success ## Iteration #1: First PCR and Gel attempts of
			E.coli system **Design:** We aimed to validate the lytic enzyme PeiR [1]
			by cloning it into *E. coli* using the pSB1K3 [2] plasmid vector. Our
			construct included two different promoters: the T7 promoter and a
			Constitutive promoter, as there is no existing research on which would
			yield higher enzyme expression efficiency. Based on our advisors’
			recommendations we selected both promoters to compare their performance in
			driving PeiR expression. Additionally, we incorporated sequences such as
			the RBS and His-tag to facilitate the expression and purification of PeiR.
			The His-tags were chosen for their minimal impact on protein function,
			unlike larger markers like GFP, ensuring that PeiR’s activity remains
			unaltered. **Build:** The lytic enzyme PeiR from the prophage, psiM2 [2],
			along with several other parts, was constructed into a single sequence and
			ordered as gBlocks from IDT. Different variations of these sequences were
			designed to include the BioBrick prefix and suffix to facilitate Gibson
			Assembly. We tested four plasmid systems with different gene sequence
			variations of BioBrick prefix/suffix, T7 promoter, Constitutive promoter,
			PeiR, His-Tag, and RBS. This design enabled seamless integration into the
			pSB1K3 plasmid, which already contained the prefix/suffix sites.
			Initially, we believed that the BioBrick prefix/suffix had to be present
			within the plasmid itself to ensure that our gene of insert followed the
			Accepted Standards on the Registry [4]. Polyhistidine tags (His-tags) were
			used to mark PeiR so that it would ease the process of purification of the
			recombinant protein. His-tags are particularly effective during protein
			purification techniques like Immobilized Metal Affinity Chromatography
			(IMAC).
		</div>
		<div>
			**Test:** We used PCR to amplify the four gBlocks (O1 to O4), via NEB Q5
			Hi-Fi 2X Master Mix protocol. The PCR amplification of the restriction
			enzyme (RE) digested pSB1K3 vector, as per iGEM’s protocol [5] was
			unsuccessful on the gel electrophoresis, as no bands appeared.
			Additionally, the A260/A280 ratio increased significantly from 1.8 after
			every PCR reaction.
		</div>
		<div>
			**Learn:** The increase in the A260/A280 ratio during our gel
			electrophoresis testing implied a problem with the digestion process. We
			decided to remove the BioBrick prefix suffix sites for the gene inserts O1
			to O4 and pSB1K3. This then inspired a new iteration of redesigning
			primers for the Engineering Design Cycle with new gene inserts in our
			finalized recombinant plasmids.
		</div>
		<div>
			## Iteration #2: PCR Optimization of pSBK13 Design: After redesigning our
			primers, we initially attempted to use a digested pSB1K3. However, due to
			iGEM rules stating that linearized plasmid backbones must be cut with
			EcoRI and PstI and adjusted to 25 ng/µL at 50 µL, we encountered issues
			when no bands appeared following digestion. As a result, we decided to
			skip the restriction enzyme (RE) digestion of the vector and use the
			amplified linearized vector for Gibson assembly. To facilitate this
			process, we redesigned the primers to include the sequence without the
			BioBrick prefix and suffix. Build: Utilized the same methodology as
			Iteration #1 to design new primers on SnapGene and ordered from IDT.
			However, our PCR optimization included performing a PCR gradient to find
			the proper annealing temperature and adjusting the initial DNA
			concentration for better amplification of pSB1K3. Test: We conducted tests
			on the four gene constructs (O1 to O4) under similar PCR conditions for
			50uL reactions based on NEB’s Q5 Master Mix protocol [6]. For pSB1K3, we
			performed a PCR gradient, adjusting the annealing temperatures from 66°C
			to 64°C. Initially, we used higher primer concentrations of approximately
			0.5 µM; however, we decreased this to ~0.25 µM for the lower annealing
			temperatures to optimize amplification results. The annealing temperatures
			of 63°C and 64°C and the primer concentration of 0.25 µM were successful
			changes. Furthermore, the inserts O1 to O4, were each ligated into the
			vector pSB1K3 via Gibson assembly. After electroporation the cultures were
			spread onto KanR plates, however, no colonies appeared.
		</div>
		<div>
			Learn: The results from our testing show that various factors, such as
			primer concentration and annealing temperatures, significantly impact PCR
			amplification and the success of Gibson assembly. By adjusting these
			variables and troubleshooting them one at a time, we can effectively
			improve our amplification results. This process highlighted the importance
			of optimizing conditions, including ensuring the correct DNA ratio between
			the insert and vector (~50 ng each) during Gibson assembly. We are
			actively working toward a solution by refining the digestion and
			incubation processes, as well as systematically testing these variables to
			improve the assembly's success rate. This knowledge not only enhances our
			current project but also provides valuable insights for future iGEM
			projects, enabling us to engineer *C. vulgaris* to express PeiR with
			greater efficiency.
		</div>
		<div>
			## Iteration # 3: First cloning attempts of C.vulgaris system Design: We
			aim to engineer *Chlorella vulgaris* (C. *vulgaris*) to express PeiR, a
			lytic enzyme that targets *Methanobrevibacter ruminantium* M1. The goal is
			to reduce methane emissions from cattle by applying this system to crops
			like corn and wheat. The PeiR gene was optimized for *C. vulgaris* from
			Twist Bioscience. This design serves as a proof-of-concept for plant-based
			methane reduction solutions. Build: To transform *C. vulgaris*, an
			Agrobacterium-mediated transformation system (AGMT) was implemented [7].
			AGMT employs pathogenic bacteria as a vector to introduce genes into
			plants. *C. vulgaris* was subcultured from a stock solution, and our plant
			expression vector, pCAMBIA1302, was isolated from DH5α. *A. tumefaciens*
			cells were selected as the (AGL1) electrocompetent cells due to their
			ability to infect plant cells and transfer a specific DNA sequence. *A.
			tumefaciens* (AGL1) cells were prepared as electrocompetent cells for gene
			transfer. The plasmid pCAMBIA1302, given to us by our advisors, and the
			PeiR_OPT gene was purchased from IDT. Primer design was completed using
			NEBuilder, and all sequences were verified for alignment. Test:
			pCAMBIA1302 [7] and the insert PeiR_OPT were successfully amplified and a
			gel was run to confirm their lengths. We encountered issues after Gibson
			Assembly, with no appearance of bands for gel extraction after DPNI
			digestion. This likely resulted from inconsistent DNA concentrations or
			incomplete digestion, as the A260/A280 ratios were significantly greater
			than 1.8. *The stop codon was removed with inserted within the plasmid to
			ensure that the PeiR_OPT insert as well as the His-tag were within the
			ORF.
		</div>
		<div>
			Learn: The process provided insights into the need for better preparation,
			such as timing experiments and ensuring all media/reagents are ready in
			advance. Further concentration checks and adjustments to the digestion
			protocol are planned before attempting the assembly again. The challenges
			in the transfection process of *A. tumefaciens* into *C. vulgaris*
			highlighted procedural gaps. Additionally, feedback from stakeholders
			raised concerns about the enzyme's potential impact on anaerobic
			digesters. As a result, experiments are being designed to test enzyme
			stability across varying pH levels in the cow’s stomach compartments,
			ensuring proper degradation before reaching waste.
